    <p>As a person that frequents the gym, I love to eat this dish to get my protein for the day at a level that I want. 
    I love broccoli and I love beef, so why not mix the both? This dish requires at least one hour of your time to make and a smile on your face as you smell the sweet aroma of cow meat and 
    and hearty broccoli being cooked together in an air fryer.</p>
